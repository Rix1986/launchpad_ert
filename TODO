- Think about the best way to separate serial read/write
- Non-blocking serial read (how to deliver result to the model?...)
- New blocks: ADC, DAC, PWM
- PIL Profiling
- What if PIL mode is enabled with serial read/write blocks?...
- Other chips than 2553
- More robust installation
- More documentation
- Create a BSW layer to supply signal values to application software
   Actually, for now all blocks are blocking. We only have rt_OneStep()
   running on an interrupt. We could make async serial RX/TX and
   temperature (ADC10) at least, updating in ISR. Then the BSW layer would provide those
   to the aplication layer as global variables.
   It also means that such BSW needs to be configurable - because our model
   might not have all of the supported blocks in it. What is the best way to
   configure BSW? Auto generate the file during build...?
- Support for multirate/reference models. This especially makes sense it we don't have BSW.
  Some models can run at higher speeds to "emulate" BSW...
- It is possible to sleep when waiting for temperature readings. Then ADC10_ISR will
  just wake up the program when reading is ready. I guess this 
  is something in between "stupid blocking mode with __delay" and "ISR + smart BSW" :)
